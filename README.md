A beautiful, client-side JSON visualizer that transforms your JSON data into an interactive node graph. Made with [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) <3

## Why we built this
- **No size limits** - There's no limit to how big your JSON can be. Your computer catching fire is the limit
- **100% client-side** - legend says the app doesn't even run on a server
- **Actually free** - No account, no paywalls, no upscale cloud BS

## Features
- Interactive node-based graph visualization
- Supports large JSON files without restrictions
- Repair broken json
- No data ever leaves your browser

## Todo
- [x] Implement JSON repair 
- [ ] Should allow for stringify json as well as non parsed json copied from the terminal 
    - The [OBJECT] should just be treated as a string
